#### Tool: Lucidchart

#### Purpose: To show an understanding of the relationship between business processes expressed in records.

#### Description: These projects result from working on information obtained in different tasks. At the moment, these diagrams demonstrate what the display of processes occurring inside business operations can look like.

#### Business use: This process can identify problems occurring at certain stages of one or more processes and save time searching for this problem. Because it displays all the steps of a particular function, it can also be used to explain a process's actions to a person who wants to understand it and develop a way to improve or speed up the process.
